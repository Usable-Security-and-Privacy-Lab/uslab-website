## Invitation to participate

We are inviting you to participate in this research study because you are an
expert in the field of usable security and privacy research. Choosing whether or
not to participate is entirely your choice. If you decide not to participate,
there will be no negative impacts on your relationship with the researcher. The
information provided in this form tells you about our study investigating expert
perspectives on addressing technology-related concerns and threats in usable
security and privacy research.

## Purpose of the research study

The purpose of this research study is to gain insights into expert perspectives
on addressing technology-related concerns in usable security and privacy
research. We aim to understand best practices, methodologies, and long-term
goals when conducting such research.

## What you will be asked to do

If you agree to participate in the study, you will participate in an interview
about your research practices related to studying technology-related threats. We
anticipate the interview will last approximately 30-35 minutes.

## Who can take part in the research study?

You are eligible to participate in this study if you are an expert in the field
of usable security and privacy research, currently conducting research in this
area. You must be a resident of the United States, Canada, or a country in
Europe. Additionally, you must be at least 18 years old and fluent in English.

## Possible risks and benefits

Risks: We will only ask you about your research practices, so there is minimal
risk. We have procedures in place to protect your privacy and confidentiality,
which are described later in this form. Benefits: There are no direct benefits
to participating in this study. However, there may be indirect benefits, such as
contributing valuable insights that could influence future research and practice
in the field.

## Compensation

There are no monetary compensation or financial benefits associated with
participating in this study.

## Privacy and confidentiality

We will record the audio of the interview, transcribe it, and then delete the
original audio recording. We will anonymize the transcript to avoid identifying
you. We may share these transcripts with other researchers, but they will always
be stored in password protected folders. You will not be identified by name in
any reports of the completed study. In our conversations, we may reference a
paper you have co-authored; however, we will redact the transcript to remove any
references to the paper or specific details that could de-anonymize you. No
personal information will be shared with anyone outside of the core research
team, unless required by law.

- allow you to have data portability by giving you a copy of your data
- allow you to withdraw consent at any time

## Reporting of Results

The results of this study, which focuses on experts in usable security and
privacy, will be shared through various means, including published research
papers, conference presentations, and other scholarly publications. All findings
will be reported in aggregate form to ensure that individual participants are
not identifiable. Any quotes used will be anonymized and will not be attributed
to specific individuals. At the end of the research, all collected data will be
securely stored and retained for future analysis in line with ethical
guidelines. Anonymized data may be used in future studies, but participants'
identities will always remain confidential.

will not affect your relationship with the researchers. If you choose to
withdraw during an interview or focus group, removing your data may be
difficult, but we will make every effort to minimize the inclusion of your
specific contributions. If you decide to withdraw after the session, please
contact the research team, and we will do our best to accommodate your request.

Study. I give permission for BYU to use the Media in scientific publications,
scientific conferences or meetings, educational presentations, public
presentations to non-scientific groups, and other uses related to the Study so
