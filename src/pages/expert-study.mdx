## Purpose of the research study

We want to gain insights into expert perspectives on addressing
technology-related threats in usable security and privacy research. We aim to
understand best practices, methodologies, and long-term goals when conducting
such research.

## Procedures

- You will be interviewed for 30 to 35 minutes about your research that
  investigates technology-related threats to individuals.
- The interview will take place at SOUPS 2024 or using Zoom, at your
  convenience.
- We will record the audio of your interview, transcribe it, redact it for any
  identifying information, and then delete the original audio file.
- The researcher may contact you at a later time to clarify answers for
  approximately 15 minutes.
- Your total time commitment is 30 to 50 minutes.

## Risks/discomforts

We will only ask you about your research practices, so there is minimal risk. We
have procedures in place to protect your privacy and confidentiality, which are
described later in this form.

## Benefits

There are no direct benefits to participating in this study. However, there may
be indirect benefits, such as contributing valuable insights that could
influence future research and practice in the field.

## Compensation

There is no monetary compensation or financial benefits associated with
participating in this study.

## Privacy and confidentiality

We will record the audio of the interview, transcribe it, and then delete the
original audio recording. We will anonymize the transcript to avoid identifying
you. We may share these transcripts with other researchers, but they will always
be stored in password protected folders. You will not be identified by name in
any reports of the completed study. In our conversations, we may reference a
paper you have co-authored; however, we will redact the transcript to remove any
references to the paper or specific details that could de-anonymize you. No
personal information will be shared with anyone outside of the core research
team.
