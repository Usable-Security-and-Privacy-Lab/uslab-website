Our lab focuses on helping people protect their security and privacy online. We
conduct human-focused research and develop human-focused secure and private
systems.

Current projects include:

- Understanding how mental models and threat models vary across different
  authentication contexts

- Comparing FIDO2 security keys and Passkeys to passwords

- Identifying the threat modeling process that researchers use when studying the
  needs of a population

# Recruiting

We are
[currently recruiting experts who study threats to people in usable security and privacy](/expert-study).
