new Study Data may be created. The Research Team will collect and use the
following types of Study Data for this research:

United States. The United States does not have the same laws to protect your
Study Data as States in the EU/EEA. However, the research team is committed to
protecting the confidentiality of your Study Data. Additional information about
the protections we will use is included in the consent document.
